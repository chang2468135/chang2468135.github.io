I am now a research intern at State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University. Before that I received my master’s degree in electrical engineering (EE) from Xi'an Jiaotong University in June 2021, and the bachelor’s degree 2018 in electrical engineering (EE) from Xi'an Jiaotong University in June 2018. During my undergraduate study, I visited NUS and worked on 3D graphics rendering.

As for personal ability, my GPA is 88.28 (rank: 16/352) during undergraduate education while it is 90 (rank: 4/58) during postgraduate study. 

I am well-grounded in Computer Programming (97), Digital Electronics (99), Physics (97), Microcomputer Principal (98), Computer Network and Communication (92), Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry (91), Advanced Fundamentals of Circuits (97), Complex Function and Integral Transformation (92), Electric Machinery (92), Electric Networks Theory (96) and Automatic Control Theory (93).
